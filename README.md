# Description
Foundry VTT Module. Help determine the difficulty of combat encounters using this benchmark method. Modeled after [Sly Flourish's Lazy DM Prep](https://slyflourish.com/), and detailed in The Lazy DM's Forge of Foes (https://shop.slyflourish.com/products/forge-of-foes), authored by Teos Abadia, Scott Fitzgerald, and Michael E. Shea.

A <i>Deadly Encounter Benchmark</i> is a guideline that helps determine an encounter's difficulty.

An encounter might be deadly if the sum total of monster challenge ratings is greater than:
- 1/4 of the sum total of character levels, for characters of 1st to 4th level;
- 1/2 of the sum total of character levels, for characters of 5th to 10th level;
- 3/4 of the sum total of character levels, for characters of 11th to 16th level;
- equal to the sum total of character levels, for characters 17th level or higher.

If friendly NPCs join the encounter, their CR values are added to the <i>Deadly Encounter Benchmark</i>.

A deadly encounter means:
- Most characters might lose more than half their hit points.
- Several characters might go unconscious.
- Thereâ€™s a chance that one or more characters might die.

Once installed and actived, a <i>Deadly Encounter Benchmark</i> button will appear under the Token Controls menu.

v1.3.2
- Updated to latest Foundry version

v1.3.1
- removed the border around each token in the DEBM dialog

v1.3.0
- Updated for v11
- Removed the "display as fraction" option. This is now the default
- Pop-up now displays selected token image. When hovered with mouse, will display the token CR or level

v1.2.4
- Fixed an issue where Deadly Encounter Benchmark caused the AC in the default character sheet to change position and keep the tooltip up permanently when hovered over with mouse.

v1.2.3
- Fixed a bug where Friendly NPC CR would not be added to the  Deadly Encounter Benchmark if the "Display as fraction" option was enabled.

v1.2.2
- Quick code fix

v1.2.1
- Added a warning message if the "Display Token Outline" option is enable but Token Magic FX is not enable or not installed

v1.2.0
- Refined the dialog pop-up display to be similar to ironmonk88's "Monks Little Details."
- Added a tooltip option to display a tooltip that helps explain the Deadly Encounter Benchmark calculation.
- Added an option to display the Deadly Encounter Benchmark as a chat message, rather than a pop-up dialog box.

v1.1.0
- Added a settings menu
- Added an option to make all values under "1" show up as a fraction (similar to how CR is traditionally represented in 5e)
- Added an option to display a highlight around all selected tokens when the Deadly Encounter Benchmark is activated. This makes it a bit easier to see which tokens are included in the calculation. This can be slow if there are too many tokens selected. Recommended use only when a few tokens are selected. This option REQUIRES the [Token Magic FX](https://github.com/Feu-Secret/Tokenmagic) module to also be installed an activated.
